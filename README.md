# Filipino Restaurant Menu App

<li>This application displays a menu with various Filipino food, organized into different categories. 
The user may interact to see the ingredients of the dish as well as its price and its availability.
</li>

<br/>

<li>This application was created using Django as the Python framework, HTML and CSS, as well 
as SQLite to store the menu items. </li>

<br/> 

<li>My primary goal with this project was to continue practicing Django and SQLite. In the future, I plan to use this same 
"blueprint" to create a small blog. </li>
